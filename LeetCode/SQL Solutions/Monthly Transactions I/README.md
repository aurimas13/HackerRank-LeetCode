The problem description of "Monthly Transactions I" is found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/monthly-transactions-i) while the solution is [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/Solutions-To-Problems/blob/main/LeetCode/SQL%20Solutions/Monthly%20Transactions%20I/monthly.sql).

**Explanation**:

1. **DATE_FORMAT(trans_date, '%Y-%m') AS month**: This extracts the month and year from the `trans_date` column so we can group by it.
2. **COUNT(id) AS trans_count**: This counts all transactions for each group.
3. **SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS approved_count**: This counts only the approved transactions for each group.
4. **SUM(amount) AS trans_total_amount**: This sums the amounts for all transactions in each group.
5. **SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS approved_total_amount**: This sums the amounts only for the approved transactions in each group.

Finally, we **GROUP BY** both the month and country, so we get results for each month and country combination.

**Practical Implementation**:

1. **Performance Monitoring**: With the monthly country-wise breakdown, the company can measure its growth or decline in each market. For instance, if the total number of transactions or the approved transaction count drops significantly in a month for a specific country, it might indicate issues like technical glitches, stricter regulations, or increased competition.

2. **Financial Planning**: By understanding the monthly approved transaction amounts, the company can forecast its revenue and plan its financial strategies. If a particular country is showing a substantial increase in approved amounts, the company might consider further investments there.

3. **Risk Management**: High numbers of declined transactions in a specific country might be a sign of fraudulent activities, or it could indicate a need to refine the payment gateways or checkout processes in that region.

4. **Marketing and Promotions**: If during a particular month, there's a noticeable decline in transactions or approved amounts, marketing teams can respond by launching targeted promotional campaigns to boost sales.

5. **Stakeholder Reporting**: Shareholders and investors are always keen to know how a company is performing in different markets. This monthly breakdown can be a part of the company's monthly or quarterly reports to give stakeholders insights into the company's performance in different regions.

In essence, having a monthly breakdown of transactions by country and understanding the proportions of approved vs. declined transactions is invaluable for any international business. It helps in strategic decision-making, optimizing operations, and identifying areas of growth or concern.
