Problem description of "Climbing Stairs" can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/) while the solution is [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/Solutions-To-Problems/blob/main/LeetCode/Java%20Solutions/Climbing%20Stairs/climb.java).

To check the solution in terminal first compile Java file as `javac climb.java`, then run the command as follows `java Solution` and it will check tests and if the solution works correctly.

## Implementation

The provided Python implementation efficiently solves the stair-climbing problem using dynamic programming. The approach is based on the realization that the problem resembles a Fibonacci sequence, where the number of ways to reach a particular step is the sum of ways to reach the two preceding steps. Both implementations are linear in time complexity and constant in space complexity, making them highly efficient and suitable for solving large instances of the problem.
