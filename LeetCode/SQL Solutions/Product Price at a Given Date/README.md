The problem description of "Product Price at a Given Date" is found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-price-at-a-given-date/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50) while the solution is found [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/Solutions-To-Problems/blob/main/LeetCode/SQL%20Solutions/Product%20Price%20at%20a%20Given%20Date/product.sql).

**Explanation**:

1. The outer query is designed to go over distinct product IDs to get prices for each of them.
2. For each product ID, the inner query:
Filters for records where the change_date is on or before '2019-08-16' because we want the price of the product on '2019-08-16'.
Orders these records in descending order of change_date because we want the latest price change before or on '2019-08-16'.
Uses LIMIT 1 to get only the topmost (latest) price change.
3. The IFNULL function is used to handle cases where there are no price changes for the product on or before '2019-08-16'. In these cases, the default price of 10 is used.

**Implementation**:

Let's consider an e-commerce platform where product prices change frequently based on various factors like demand, supply, discounts, etc. On a particular day, a marketing team wants to analyze the price of all products to make some strategic decisions for their campaigns. To make sure they're considering the correct prices, they'd use a query similar to the one above to fetch the prices of all products on the desired date. This will ensure they are using the most recent and accurate data for their analysis and strategies.
