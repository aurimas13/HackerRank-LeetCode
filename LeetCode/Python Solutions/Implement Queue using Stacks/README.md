## Implemetation

The Python solution implements a FIFO queue using two stacks, stack1 for enqueue operations and stack2 for dequeue operations. The key to achieving O(1) amortized time complexity for pop/peek operations lies in lazy transfer of elements from stack1 to stack2, which only occurs when stack2 is empty and a pop/peek operation is requested. This ensures that the elements are in reverse order in stack2, enabling FIFO behavior. The push operation is always O(1) as it simply pushes elements onto stack1. The empty operation checks if both stacks are empty. The overall space complexity is O(n), as it depends on the total number of elements in the queue. This implementation provides an efficient queue operation using stack primitives, suitable for situations where only stack data structures are available.
