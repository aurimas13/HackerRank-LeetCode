## Implementation

1. Dynamic Typing and Conciseness:

    Python's dynamic typing allows for more concise code. For instance, you don't need to declare the type of variables explicitly.
Example: no_losses = set() and loss_count = {} are straightforward and concise ways to initialize a set and a dictionary.

2. Easy-to-use Data Structures:

    Pythonâ€™s built-in data structures like set and dict are powerful and user-friendly. They support a variety of operations with simple syntax.
Example: no_losses.add(winner) and loss_count[loser] += 1 demonstrate straightforward operations on these data structures.

3. Elegant Iteration:

    Python's for-loops are elegant and can directly iterate over elements of a list or keys of a dictionary.
Example: for winner, loser in matches: is a clean way to unpack match results directly in the loop declaration.

4. List Comprehensions and Built-in Functions:

    Python supports list comprehensions and has built-in functions like sorted() for easy manipulation of lists.
Example: sorted(no_losses) is a concise way to sort and return a new list.
