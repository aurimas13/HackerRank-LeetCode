The problem description of "Employee Bonus" is found [here]](https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-bonus/description/) while the solution is found [here]().

**Explanation**

`SELECT e.name, b.bonus`:

Here, we're specifying which columns we want in our final result set. We want the name of the employee from the Employee table and the bonus from the Bonus table.

`FROM Employee AS e`:

We're using the Employee table as the main table for our query, and we give it an alias e for easier referencing in the subsequent parts of the query.

`LEFT JOIN Bonus AS b ON e.empId = b.empId`:

A LEFT JOIN returns all the rows from the left table (Employee in our case) and the matching rows from the right table (Bonus). If there's no match, the result is NULL in the columns of the right table. This is essential for our problem since we want employees who didn't get a bonus (i.e., those with NULL bonuses) as well.

AS b is just an alias for the Bonus table, much like the alias for Employee.

ON e.empId = b.empId is the condition for the join. We're matching employees in the Employee table with their corresponding bonus entry in the Bonus table based on the empId.

`WHERE b.bonus < 1000 OR b.bonus IS NULL`:

This is a filter condition. We're only interested in employees whose bonus is less than 1000 or those who didn't receive a bonus (represented as NULL in the Bonus table).

`ORDER BY`:

We want to sort the result based on two criteria:

First, we want those with no bonuses at the top.

Next, among those who received a bonus, we want to list them in increasing order of the bonus amount.

CASE
WHEN b.bonus IS NULL THEN 1
ELSE 0
END:

This CASE statement is used within the ORDER BY clause to prioritize the ordering. If an employee's bonus is null, it assigns a value of 1, otherwise 0. This means when the result set is being ordered, it'll first bring rows where the bonus is NULL (because of the value 1).

**b.bonus**:

This is the second criterion for ordering. After grouping all null bonuses together (thanks to our CASE statement), it orders the rest of the employees based on the bonus value in ascending order.

In summary, this SQL solution allows you to extract a list of employees who either didn't get a bonus or got a bonus of less than 1000. It's tailored to bring employees with no bonuses at the top and then lists the rest in increasing order of bonus amounts.

**Practical Implementation**

Imagine you're working in the HR department of a multinational corporation. Every end of the fiscal year, employees are awarded bonuses based on their performance. However, not everyone might get a bonus due to various reasons such as performance, the department they are in, or budgetary constraints.

Now, for various administrative and reporting reasons, you're tasked with creating a list of employees who either:

Did not receive a bonus.
Received a bonus but it's less than 1000 units (could be dollars, euros, etc.).
This information is vital for several reasons:

Feedback: Employees who didn't receive a bonus or received a small bonus might require feedback or training.

Budget Planning: Understanding how many employees fall below a certain bonus threshold can be essential for future budgeting.

Reporting: Senior management might want a report of bonuses for transparency and governance reasons.

You're given access to the company's database which has an Employee table detailing all the employees and a Bonus table which contains bonus information. Some employees might not have an entry in the Bonus table, indicating they didn't receive a bonus.

To create the required list efficiently, you turn to SQL to extract this information and use this my provided extra query to get the names of the employees who didn't receive a bonus.
