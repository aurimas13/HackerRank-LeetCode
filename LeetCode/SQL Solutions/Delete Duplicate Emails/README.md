The problem description of "Delete Duplicate Emails" is found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-duplicate-emails/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50) while the solution is found [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/Solutions-To-Problems/blob/main/LeetCode/SQL%20Solutions/Delete%20Duplicate%20Emails/delete.sql). 

**Explanation**:

1. The SQL DELETE command is used to remove rows from a table. In this solution, we are deleting rows from the Person table aliased as p1.

2. The JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column. Here, we are joining the Person table with itself based on the email column. We are essentially comparing every row with every other row in the table. p1 and p2 are simply aliases for the two "copies" of the table.

3. The WHERE clause is used to filter rows. In this solution, we only want to delete a row from p1 if there exists another row in p2 with the same email but a smaller id. Thus, the condition p1.id > p2.id ensures that we are only deleting the rows with duplicate emails that have higher id values.

**Implementation**:

Imagine you're managing a database for an email subscription service. Over time, users might sign up with the same email multiple times, perhaps due to forgetting they already have an account or due to some backend system error that recorded them more than once.

To ensure that you don't send multiple copies of the same email to the same user, you'd want to clean up your database and remove these duplicates. This solution helps in such scenarios by ensuring that only the earliest (smallest id) record for each email is retained.

Another real-life example could be when consolidating data from multiple sources. It's not uncommon to get duplicate records when merging data. A query like this ensures that your final dataset is free from such redundancies.
