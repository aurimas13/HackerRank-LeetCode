**Implementation**:

Imagine you're an HR manager in a company. You've been asked by senior management to provide insights into the company's payroll, especially to understand how competitive the salaries are. One of the pieces of data you're asked for is the second highest salary in the company to compare it against industry standards.

Using this SQL solution, you can quickly pull up that data. It would be especially helpful if the company has thousands of employees, making it infeasible to sort through all salaries manually. This query provides an efficient way to get that information.

However, in a real-world scenario, you would probably also want to consider other factors, like job role, experience level, location, etc. Still, for a quick insight, the provided query serves its purpose.
