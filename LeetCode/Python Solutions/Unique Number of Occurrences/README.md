The problem description of "Unique Number of Occurrences" can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-number-of-occurrences/) while the solution can be found [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/Solutions-To-Problems/blob/main/LeetCode/Python%20Solutions/Unique%20Number%20of%20Occurrences/unique.py).

## Implementation

The provided Python implementation efficiently solves the problem by first counting the occurrences of each element using a hash map and then checking for the uniqueness of these occurrences. The key insight is that if the size of the set of occurrence counts is equal to the size of the occurrence map, then all counts are unique. This implementation achieves linear time complexity, making them suitable for large datasets and aligning with the constraints of the problem.
