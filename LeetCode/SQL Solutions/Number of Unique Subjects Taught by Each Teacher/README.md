The problem description of "Number of Unique Subjects Taught by Each Teacher" is found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-unique-subjects-taught-by-each-teacher/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50) while the solution is found [here]().

**Explanation**:

1. `FROM Teacher`:

- This part of the query specifies the source table, Teacher, from which we're retrieving data.

2. `GROUP BY teacher_id`:

- The GROUP BY clause groups the records based on the teacher_id. This means we will perform our calculations (like counting subjects) separately for each unique teacher in the table.

3. `COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id) AS cnt`:

- For each group (i.e., each unique teacher), we want to know how many unique subjects they teach. This is achieved using the COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id) function.

- The DISTINCT keyword ensures that we are counting each subject only once, regardless of how many departments the teacher might be teaching that subject in.

- The AS cnt part renames the resulting column as "cnt".

**Implementation**:

Imagine a large university where teachers may teach the same subject in multiple departments. For example, a mathematics professor could be teaching "Calculus" in both the Engineering and Science faculties. For administrative or academic evaluation purposes, the university might want to know how many unique subjects each professor teaches, regardless of the departmental overlaps.

Using this query, the university can quickly identify:

- Teachers who are versatile and teach multiple unique subjects.
- Teachers who might be overburdened (if they're teaching many unique subjects).
- Teachers who specialize in only one subject.

Moreover, this information can be valuable for:

- Allocating resources: If a teacher is teaching many unique subjects, they might need more support, resources, or even teaching assistants.
- Career development: Recognizing teachers who showcase their versatility might lead to promotions or special assignments.
- Curriculum planning: Identifying the subjects taught by teachers can help in scheduling classes for upcoming semesters or in reshuffling departmental responsibilities.

Overall, this simple SQL query provides a foundational piece of data that can be used in various decision-making processes within an educational institution.
