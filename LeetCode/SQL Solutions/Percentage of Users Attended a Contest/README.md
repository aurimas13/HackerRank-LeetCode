The problem description of "Percentage of Users Attended a Contest" can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/percentage-of-users-attended-a-contest/description) while the solution is found [here]().

**Explanation**:

1. **SELECT contest_id**: This selects the `contest_id` from the **Register** table.

2. **ROUND(100 * COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users), 2) AS percentage**:
    - **COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)**: Counts the number of unique users for each contest_id.
    - **(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users)**: This subquery gets the total number of users.
    - **100 * COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users)**: This calculates the percentage of users that attended a particular contest.
    - **ROUND(..., 2)**: Rounds the result to two decimal places.

3. **GROUP BY contest_id**: This groups the results by `contest_id` so that we get one row per contest.

4. **ORDER BY percentage DESC, contest_id**: This orders the results by `percentage` in descending order and then by `contest_id` in ascending order.

**Practical Implementation**:

1. **Educational Institutions**: Suppose a university or school hosts a series of lectures, workshops, or seminars. They may want to know which lectures or workshops were most attended by students to gauge interest in topics, determine the effectiveness of marketing for the event, or decide on resource allocation for future events.

2. **E-commerce Platforms**: They might organize a series of online sales events or flash sales. By gauging participation, they can better plan inventory, marketing spend, and focus for future sales events.

3. **Conference Organizers**: Organizers of tech conferences, workshops, or webinars might want to gauge which sessions or tracks had the highest attendance. This helps in determining popular topics and can guide planning for future events.

4. **Healthcare Providers**: In the case of flu shot campaigns or other health drive campaigns, health organizations can gauge participation to determine the effectiveness of the campaign.

5. **Loyalty Programs**: Companies or retail chains with loyalty programs often have special events, sales, or promotions for their members. Analyzing attendance or participation can help refine future offerings or promotions.

6. **Online Gaming Platforms**: If a platform hosts multiple gaming contests or tournaments, understanding participation can help in scheduling future tournaments or optimizing server resources.

7. **Mobile App Developers**: For developers who launch multiple app-related contests or campaigns to boost user engagement, analyzing user participation can give insights into user preferences and behavior.

8. **Government or Public Organizations**: For public awareness campaigns, voting drives, or any other public initiative, gauging participation can provide insights into the success of the initiative and areas of improvement.
