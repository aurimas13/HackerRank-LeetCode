The problem of "Minimum Falling Path Sum" can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-falling-path-sum/description/) while the solution [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/Solutions-To-Problems/blob/main/LeetCode/Python%20Solutions/Minimum%20Falling%20Path%20Sum/minimum.py).

## Implementation

The Python solution provided efficiently solve the problem by using a dynamic programming approach to find the minimum falling path sum in a given matrix. The key is to iteratively update each element with the minimum sum possible based on the values from the previous row, and finally return the minimum value found in the last row. This approach ensures that all possible falling paths are considered, and the one with the minimum sum is chosen. The time complexity is quadratic, which is optimal for this problem, and the space complexity is constant since no additional data structures are used.
