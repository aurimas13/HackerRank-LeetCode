**Implementation**

Suppose you are managing a fleet of drones in a city, with each node being a significant point of interest or a delivery point. This algorithm could be used to find the shortest possible route for a drone to visit all the points of interest (possibly revisiting some) and return to its starting point, ensuring timely deliveries or coverage of all locations.
