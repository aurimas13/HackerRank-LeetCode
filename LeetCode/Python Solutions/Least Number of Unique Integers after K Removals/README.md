The problem description of "Least Number of Unique Integers after K Removals" can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/least-number-of-unique-integers-after-k-removals/description/) and the solution can be found [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/LeetCode-HackerRank-MAANG/blob/main/LeetCode/Python%20Solutions/Least%20Number%20of%20Unique%20Integers%20after%20K%20Removals/least.py).

## Explanation

- The core logic involves counting frequencies, sorting or prioritizing them based on frequency, and then iteratively removing elements based on their frequency until k is exhausted.

- The correct output for the example [5,5,4] with k = 1 should indeed be 2, as removing one occurrence of 4 leaves two unique integers, 5 and 4. The original output seems to be consistent with understanding the problem statement; thus, any confusion might stem from misinterpreting the result or an error in submitting the problem solution.
