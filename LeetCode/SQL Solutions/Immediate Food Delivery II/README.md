The problem descripition of "Immediate Food Delivery II" is found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/immediate-food-delivery-ii/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50) while the solution is found [here]().

**Explanation**:

1. **The FirstOrder CTE**:

```sql
WITH FirstOrder AS (
    SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date) as first_order_date
    FROM Delivery
    GROUP BY customer_id
)
```

This part of the query uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) called FirstOrder. A CTE is a temporary result set that can be referred within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.

What we're doing here is grouping the Delivery table by customer_id and for each customer, we are selecting the earliest (or minimum) order_date. This gives us the date of the first order made by each customer.

2. **The ImmediateFirstOrder CTE**:

```sql
ImmediateFirstOrder AS (
    SELECT d.customer_id
    FROM FirstOrder fo
    JOIN Delivery d 
    ON fo.customer_id = d.customer_id AND fo.first_order_date = d.order_date
    WHERE d.order_date = d.customer_pref_delivery_date
)
```
In this CTE, we're joining our previous CTE (FirstOrder) with the Delivery table. The purpose of this join is to match each customer's first order with the original Delivery table so that we can get details like the customer_pref_delivery_date.

From this joined data, we then filter out only those rows where the order_date is the same as customer_pref_delivery_date. This gives us only the first orders which are "immediate".

3. **Main Query**:

```sql
SELECT ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM FirstOrder), 2) AS immediate_percentage
FROM ImmediateFirstOrder;
```

In the main query, we calculate the percentage of immediate first orders by taking the count of rows in the ImmediateFirstOrder CTE and dividing it by the count of rows in the FirstOrder CTE (which represents the total number of customers). The multiplication by 100.0 converts this fraction into a percentage, and ROUND(..., 2) ensures we get the result rounded to two decimal places.

**Practical Implementation**:

Let's assume we're working for an online e-commerce platform. When a user makes their first purchase, they're given an option to either get the delivery on the same day (if they order by a specific time) or schedule it for a later date. The business believes that users who choose immediate delivery on their first order are more likely to be impulsive buyers and they want to target these users with flash sales.

To target these users, the business needs data. They want to know the percentage of users who chose immediate delivery on their first order. This percentage will help them understand their user base better and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly.

Using the provided SQL query, the data team of the e-commerce platform can quickly get this percentage and provide insights to the marketing team. Based on this, the marketing team can plan flash sales, send promotional emails, or push notifications targeting these immediate-delivery-first-order users.
