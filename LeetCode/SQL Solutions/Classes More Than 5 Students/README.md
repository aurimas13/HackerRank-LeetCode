**Explanation**:

1. We start by selecting the class column from the Courses table.

2. We then group the results by the class column, which will aggregate the data based on unique class names.

3. After grouping, we use the HAVING clause to filter the grouped results. The HAVING clause is used to filter aggregate results. In this case, we want to include only those classes where the count of students is 5 or more. Hence, we use the COUNT(student) >= 5 condition.

4. This will return all classes that have at least five students.

**Implementation**:

Suppose a school wants to allocate rooms for various classes based on student enrollment. Before allocating the largest rooms (that can accommodate many students), the school administration wants to first identify all classes which have a high number of enrolled students (say, 5 or more). Using the above SQL query on their student-class enrollment database, the school administration can easily identify which subjects/classes have high enrollment and then allocate rooms accordingly. This helps in efficient resource allocation based on demand.
