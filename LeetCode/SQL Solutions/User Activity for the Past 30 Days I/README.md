The problem of "User Activity for the Past 30 Days I" is found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/user-activity-for-the-past-30-days-i/description) while the solution is found [here]().

**Explanation**:

- The DATE_SUB('2019-07-27', INTERVAL 29 DAY) function subtracts 29 days from 2019-07-27, so combined with AND '2019-07-27' in the WHERE clause, it filters the records for the last 30 days including 2019-07-27.

- We then use GROUP BY activity_date to group the records by day.

- The COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) function counts the number of unique users for each day, ensuring that if a user has multiple activities on the same day, they are only counted once.

- The HAVING active_users > 0 clause ensures that we only return days where there are active users.

- Finally, the ORDER BY activity_date sorts the results by day.

**Implementation**:

Imagine a fitness mobile application where users log their workouts. The company behind the app wants to measure user engagement over the past month to see how well a recent feature update was received.

In this real-world example:

1. Data Collection: Every time a user logs a workout or uses a feature within the app, an activity is recorded in the database, much like our Activity table. It records the user_id, a session_id (which can be a unique identifier for that particular interaction instance), the activity_date, and the activity_type (e.g., 'start_workout', 'end_workout', 'view_tutorial', 'set_reminder').

2. Engagement Analysis: At the end of the month, the company wants to check how many users were active each day. They're especially interested in any spikes or drops in daily active users, which might indicate strong user reactions to certain updates or issues with the app.

3. Using the Query: By running our SQL query on the app's activity data, the company can generate a report of daily active users for the last 30 days. This data can then be plotted on a graph to visualize user engagement trends.

4. Decision Making Based on Data: If they notice a sudden drop in active users after a particular update, it may indicate an unpopular feature or a technical bug. Conversely, a spike in active users might suggest a well-received feature. Using this feedback, they can make informed decisions about future app updates or fix potential issues.

This approach of monitoring daily active users can be pivotal for businesses, helping them understand their user base better, respond to issues promptly, and optimize for greater user satisfaction and growth.
