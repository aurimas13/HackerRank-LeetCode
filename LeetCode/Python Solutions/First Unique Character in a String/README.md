Problem description of "First Unique Character in a String" can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/description/) and its solution [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/LeetCode-HackerRank-MAANG/blob/main/LeetCode/Python%20Solutions/First%20Unique%20Character%20in%20a%20String/first.py).

## Implementation

The solution efficiently solves the problem by first counting the occurrences of each character in the string and then finding the first character that only appears once. This is achieved by using a dictionary in Python and an array in Java to store the frequency of each character. The solution ensures a linear time complexity by processing each character a fixed number of times and use constant space, as the size of the data structure for counting is independent of the input string's length. This approach provides an optimal solution to the problem with minimal resource usage.
