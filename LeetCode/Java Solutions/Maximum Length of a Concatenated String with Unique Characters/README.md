The problem of "Maximum Length of a Concatenated String with Unique Characters" can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-of-a-concatenated-string-with-unique-characters/) and the solution is found [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/Solutions-To-Problems/blob/main/LeetCode/Java%20Solutions/Maximum%20Length%20of%20a%20Concatenated%20String%20with%20Unique%20Characters/maximum.java).

## Implementation

1. **Bitmask Conversion**: Each string in arr is converted into a bitmask representation, where each bit corresponds to a character in the alphabet. Strings with duplicate characters are ignored.

2. **Backtracking Function**: The backtrack function is a recursive function that takes three parameters: uniqueBitmasks (a list of bitmasks for strings with unique characters), index (the current position in uniqueBitmasks), and currentBitmask (the bitmask representing the current concatenated string).

3. **Base Case**: The recursion ends when index equals the size of uniqueBitmasks, returning the count of bits in currentBitmask as the length of the concatenated string.

4. **Combining Bitmasks**: The function explores two possibilities at each step - combining the current bitmask with currentBitmask if there's no overlap (checked using bitwise AND), or skipping the current bitmask.

5. **Max Length Calculation**: It calculates the maximum length obtained through these recursive calls.

6. **Initial Call**: The function is initially called with index 0 and a currentBitmask of 0.
