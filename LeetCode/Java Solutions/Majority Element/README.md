Problem description of "Majority Element" can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element) and its solution [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/LeetCode-HR-MAANG/blob/main/LeetCode/Java%20Solutions/Majority%20Element/majority.java).

To check the solution in terminal first compile Java file as `javac majority.java`, then run the command as follows `java Solution` and it will check tests and if the solution works correctly.

## Implementation

The Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm provides an elegant solution to the majority element problem with optimal time and space complexity. The key insight is to treat the problem as a process of finding a candidate that can "survive" the elimination process, where each step involves either pairing the candidate with a different element and "canceling them out" or incrementing the candidate's count. The algorithm guarantees that if there is a majority element, it will be the candidate after traversing the entire array, as its count cannot be reduced to zero by elements that are not the majority. This approach leverages the property that the majority element appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times, ensuring its survival through the cancellation process and thus its identification as the majority element.
