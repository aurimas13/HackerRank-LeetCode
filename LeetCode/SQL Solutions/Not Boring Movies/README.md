The problem description of "Not Boring Movies" is found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/not-boring-movies/description/) while the solution is found [here]().

**Explanation**:

1. `Subquery (Inner Query)`

- This query selects the movies with odd IDs and ratings greater than 5.
- **MOD(id, 2) = 1** - The **MOD** function gives the remainder of a division. If a number modulo 2 is 1, then it's an odd number.
- **rating > 5** - Filters out movies with a rating of 5 or less.

2. `Main Query (Outer Query)`

- It operates on the result of the subquery, which we've aliased as filtered_movies.
- **description != 'boring'** - Excludes the movies with a description labeled as "boring".
- **ORDER BY rating DESC** - Sorts the result in descending order based on the rating.

**Practical implementation**:

Let's assume you have a database for a movie review website. Users can add movies, give them ratings, and provide a short description. Over time, you notice that some descriptions are overly simplistic, like 'boring'. For a weekly feature, you decide to showcase top-rated movies, but you don't want to feature movies labeled as 'boring', nor do you want to feature movies with low ratings. Moreover, for some design reason (maybe to ensure variety), you decide to only consider movies with odd IDs.

To implement this, you'd run the above SQL query on your `cinema` table. This would give you a list of movies that fit your criteria, allowing you to feature them on your site's weekly showcase.
