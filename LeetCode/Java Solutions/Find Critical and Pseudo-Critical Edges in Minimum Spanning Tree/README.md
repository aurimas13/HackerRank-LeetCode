The problem description of "Find Critical and Pseudo-Critical Edges in Minimum Spanning Tree" is found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-critical-and-pseudo-critical-edges-in-minimum-spanning-tree/) while the solution is found [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/Solutions-To-Problems/blob/main/LeetCode/Java%20Solutions/Find%20Critical%20and%20Pseudo-Critical%20Edges%20in%20Minimum%20Spanning%20Tree/find.java).

To check the solution in terminal first compile Java file as `javac find.java`, then run the command as follows `java Solution` and it will check tests and if the solution works correctly.

**Explanation**:

1. We add an index to each edge for referencing purposes. This will allow us to determine which edges are critical or pseudo-critical by their index in the original edge list.
2. We sort the edges by their weights to make it suitable for Kruskal's algorithm.
3. We implement the union-find's find and union operations to support the Kruskal's algorithm.
4. The `kruskal function` is implemented to compute the weight of the MST. We use the banned and forced parameters to skip a particular edge or forcibly include an edge.
5. After calculating the original MST's weight, we iterate over each edge and calculate the MST weight without including this edge. If the resulting weight is more than the original MST's weight, this edge is considered critical.
6. If an edge is not critical but including it does not increase the MST's weight, it's considered pseudo-critical.

**Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(m^2 * logn + m * n) where m is the number of edges and n is the number of vertices. Or simply O(n log n). This comes from sorting the edges and repeatedly using Kruskal's algorithm.

**Space Complexity**: O(n + m) for union-find and storing the edges or simply O(n).

**Practical Implementation**:

Imagine you are building a network connecting different servers in a data center. Each server has a cost associated with connecting to another server. A critical edge in this context means that if you don't establish this connection, the overall cost of connecting all servers will increase. On the other hand, a pseudo-critical connection is one where, if you include it, it might not always lead to the minimum cost of connecting all servers.

This analysis can help data center architects make decisions on which server connections are absolutely essential and which can be considered optional or redundant.
