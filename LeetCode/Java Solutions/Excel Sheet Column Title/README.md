Problem description of "Excel Sheet Column Title" can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/excel-sheet-column-title/description/) and its solution [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/Solutions-To-Problems/blob/main/LeetCode/Java%20Solutions/Excel%20Sheet%20Column%20Title/excel.java).

To check the solution in terminal first compile Java file as `javac excel.java`, then run the command as follows `java Solution` and it will check tests and if the solution works correctly.

**Explanation**:

The Python code provided is similar to the process of converting a decimal number to binary, but in this case, we are converting the number to a base-26 number system where:

- A = 0
- B = 1
- ...
- Z = 25

To obtain each letter:

    Take the decimal number and subtract 1 from the column number.
    Take the modulus of the column number by 26 to get the remainder.
    Add the ASCII value of 'A' to the remainder to get the character representation.
    Divide the column number by 26.

Repeat the process until the column number is 0.

**Real-world Implementation**:

A possible real-world implementation is an Excel-like software where columns are represented by letters. If a developer is to build a function to translate the column index to its corresponding letter title, this function would be essential.
