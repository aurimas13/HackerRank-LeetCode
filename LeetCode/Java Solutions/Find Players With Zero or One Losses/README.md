The problem description of "Find Players With Zero or One Losses" can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-players-with-zero-or-one-records/) while the solution can be found [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/Solutions-To-Problems/blob/main/LeetCode/Java%20Solutions/Find%20Players%20With%20Zero%20or%20One%20Losses/find.java).

To check the solution in terminal first compile Java file as `javac find.java`, then run the command as follows `java Solution` and it will check tests and if the solution works correctly.

## Implementation

1. Static Typing and Explicit Declarations:

    Java requires explicit type declarations, which can make the code more verbose but also clearer in terms of data types being used.
Example: Set<Integer> noLosses = new HashSet<>(); clearly indicates that noLosses is a set of integers.

2. Use of Java Collections Framework:

    Java makes extensive use of its Collections Framework, which provides a rich set of data structures like HashSet and HashMap.
Example: lossCount.put(loser, lossCount.get(loser) + 1); shows how to work with a HashMap.

3. Enhanced For-Loop (For-Each Loop):

    Java uses enhanced for-loops to iterate over collections, providing a readable and concise way to traverse through elements.
Example: for (int[] match : matches) demonstrates an enhanced for-loop for iterating over an array of arrays.

4. Explicit Sorting and Type Conversion:

 Java requires explicit conversion of sets to lists before sorting, and uses Collections.sort() for sorting.
Example: List<Integer> noLossesList = new ArrayList<>(noLosses); Collections.sort(noLossesList); shows the conversion and sorting steps.
