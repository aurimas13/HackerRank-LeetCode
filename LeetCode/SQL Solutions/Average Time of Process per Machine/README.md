The problem description of "Average Time of Process per Machine" can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-time-of-process-per-machine/description/) while the solution [here]().

**Explanation**

1. Subquery for `start` activities:

```sql
(SELECT * FROM Activity WHERE activity_type = 'start') AS start_activity
```

This subquery fetches all the rows where the activity type is 'start'. The result from this subquery will have all the processes' start timestamps.

2. Subquery for `end` activities:

```sql
(SELECT * FROM Activity WHERE activity_type = 'end') AS end_activity
```
This subquery fetches all the rows where the activity type is 'end'. The result from this subquery will have all the processes' end timestamps.

3. Joining the Two Subqueries:

We join the two subqueries based on `machine_id` and `process_id`. This ensures that for every 'start' timestamp of a process, we match the corresponding 'end' timestamp of the same process.

```sql
ON 
start_activity.machine_id = end_activity.machine_id
AND start_activity.process_id = end_activity.process_id
```
4 Calculating the processing time:

For each pair of `start` and `end` timestamps (from the joined result), we calculate the difference to determine the processing time for that particular process.

```sql
AVG(end_activity.timestamp - start_activity.timestamp)
```

We then use the AVG function to compute the average processing time for each machine.

5. Rounding to desired precision:

We've wrapped the above average in the ROUND function to ensure that the result is rounded to three decimal places.

``` sql
ROUND(AVG(end_activity.timestamp - start_activity.timestamp), 3)
```

6. Grouping and Ordering:

Finally, we group the results by machine_id using the GROUP BY clause to get an average processing time per machine. We also order the results by machine_id for a cleaner presentation.

**Practical Implementation**

Imagine a server farm where multiple servers (machines) handle several user requests (processes). Each request goes through a series of stages on a server, starting with initialization (start) and ending with completion (end). Monitoring tools record the timestamp when each request starts and ends.

Over time, the server farm manager may want to measure the efficiency of each server. They need to know, on average, how long each server takes to handle a request. This will provide insights into:

- Identifying servers that are slower and may need maintenance or upgrades.
- Balancing the load among servers more effectively.
- Deciding when to add more servers to the farm based on how long it takes to process requests.

Using this SQL solution, the server farm manager can gain insights into the average processing time for each server. With this knowledge, they can make informed decisions about server farm optimization.
