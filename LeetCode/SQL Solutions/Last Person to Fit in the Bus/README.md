**Explanation**:

1. The WITH CTE AS defines a Common Table Expression which is a temporary result set that you can refer within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. In our case, we used the CTE to simplify the process of computing the running total weight.

2. Inside the CTE, SUM(weight) OVER (ORDER BY turn ASC) computes a running total of weights. The OVER clause defines a window or range of rows to operate on. It orders the persons by turn and then, for each person, computes the sum of weights for all preceding rows (including the current one).

3. After the CTE, our main query filters rows based on the running total weight and retrieves the person who boarded last before the weight limit was breached.

**Implementation**:

This query can be used in systems that manage boarding queues for any transport or facility that has a weight or capacity limit. For instance, cargo loading systems, elevators, amusement park rides, etc., where the weight or capacity is a constraint. By efficiently identifying the last permissible entity, such systems can optimize and maximize utilization while ensuring safety.
