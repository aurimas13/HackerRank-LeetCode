Problem description of "Find First Palindromic String in the Array" can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-palindromic-string-in-the-array/) while the solution is found [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/LeetCode-HR-MAANG/blob/main/LeetCode/Python%20Solutions/Find%20First%20Palindromic%20String%20in%20the%20Array/first.py).

## Implementation

It efficiently solves the problem by iterating through each word in the given list or array and checking if it is a palindrome. The Python solution utilizes Python's slice notation to easily reverse the word and compare it to the original. If a palindrome is found, it is immediately returned as the result; otherwise, after checking all words, an empty string is returned to indicate that no palindromic string was found in the input. This approach ensures that the solution is straightforward and efficient, with a clear step-by-step process for identifying the first palindromic word.
