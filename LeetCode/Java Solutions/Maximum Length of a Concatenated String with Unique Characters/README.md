The problem of "Maximum Length of a Concatenated String with Unique Characters" can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-of-a-concatenated-string-with-unique-characters/) and the solution is found [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/Solutions-To-Problems/blob/main/LeetCode/Python%20Solutions/Maximum%20Length%20of%20a%20Concatenated%20String%20with%20Unique%20Characters/maximum.py).

## Implementation

1. **Backtracking Function**: The backtrack function is a recursive function that takes two parameters: index, which represents the current position in the array arr, and current_set, a set that contains the unique characters of the concatenated string so far.

2. **Base Case**: The recursion ends when index equals the length of arr, returning the length of current_set as the length of the concatenated string formed so far.

3. **Inclusion and Exclusion**: At each step, the function decides whether to include the current string arr[index] in the concatenation or not. This is based on checking if the current string has unique characters and does not intersect with current_set.

4. **Max Length Calculation**: It calculates the maximum length obtained by either including or skipping the current string.

5 **Initial Call**: The function is initially called with index 0 and an empty set.
