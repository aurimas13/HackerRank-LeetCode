The problem description of "Product Sales Analysis III" is found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-sales-analysis-iii/description) while the solution is found [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/Solutions-To-Problems/blob/main/LeetCode/SQL%20Solutions/Product%20Sales%20Analysis%20III/product.sql).

**Explanation**:

1. ***CTE (Common Table Expression) with WITH Clause***: The WITH clause allows us to define a CTE named FirstYearSales that computes the first year of sale (MIN(year)) for each product (`product_id`).

2. ***Joining with the Sales Table***: In the main query, we then join the FirstYearSales CTE with the Sales table using the `product_id` and the `first_year` to get the corresponding quantity and price for that year.

**Implementation**:

Imagine a scenario where a company wants to review the initial success of their products. By identifying the sales in the first year of each product's introduction to the market, the company can determine which products had a strong start and which ones didn't. Using this information, the company can make informed decisions regarding marketing, product iteration, or even discontinuing products that had poor initial sales.
