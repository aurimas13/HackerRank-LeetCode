To check the solution in terminal first compile Java file as `javac find.java`, then run the command as follows `java Solution` and it will check tests and if the solution works correctly.

**Implementation**:

Imagine a racetrack and various checkpoints around it. If two racers start from the same checkpoint and one goes at double the speed of the other, if they are on a cyclic track, they will meet again on some checkpoint. This scenario is similar to the given problem where the checkpoints represent the numbers, and the track represents the indices of the array.
