The problem description of "Project Employees I" can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/project-employees-i/description/) while the solution is found [here]().

**Explanation**:

1. We join the **Project** table with the **Employee** table on `employee_id` to get the experience_years for each employee for each project.
2. After joining, we group the result by `project_id` to calculate the average years of experience for the employees of each project.
3. The **ROUND()** function is used to round the average experience years to 2 decimal places as required.
4. We then select the project_id and the rounded average experience years for the result.

**Practical Implementation**:

1. **Project Management and Team Allocation**:
    - **Scenario**: Imagine a project management office in a large IT firm. Before assigning a new project, the management wants to assess the average experience of different teams to ensure they assign projects based on the complexity and required expertise.
    - **Implementation**: The SQL query helps in quickly getting an overview of which teams (or projects) have more experienced members on average. Projects requiring deep expertise might be assigned to teams with higher average experience years.

2. **Resource Training and Development**:
    - **Scenario**: An organization's HR or training department wants to see which projects have less experienced teams on average. This is to prioritize which teams should be given additional training or workshops.
    - **Implementation**: By identifying teams with lower average experience, resources can be effectively channeled to enhance their skills.

3. **Client Communication and Reporting**:
    - **Scenario**: Sometimes, clients want to know the expertise level of teams working on their projects. They might want assurance that their project is being handled by experienced professionals.
    - **Implementation**: The firm can quickly generate a report using this SQL query and provide insights into the average experience level of the team handling the client's project.

4. **Internal Audit or Review**:
    - **Scenario**: Periodic reviews are conducted to assess if projects, especially critical ones, have a balanced team in terms of experience.
    - **Implementation**: The SQL query helps in quickly generating data for such reviews. If a critical project has a below-average experience level, it could be flagged for further assessment.

5. **Recruitment and Hiring**:
    - **Scenario**: The recruitment team identifies a pattern where multiple projects are skewed towards having less experienced team members.
    - **Implementation**: Using such data, they might decide to hire more senior professionals in the next hiring cycle to balance out the expertise level in the organization.

6. **Budget Allocation for Projects**:
    - **Scenario**: Projects with a higher average experience might have a higher payroll expense. When planning budgets, the finance department might want to assess average experience levels to predict payroll costs.
    - **Implementation**: This SQL query can help in assessing the average experience and, with further data, can be used to project payroll expenses for different projects.
