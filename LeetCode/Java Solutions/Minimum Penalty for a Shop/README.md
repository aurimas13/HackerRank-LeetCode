The problem description of "Minimum Penalty for a Shop" is found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-penalty-for-a-shop/description/) while the solution is found [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/Solutions-To-Problems/blob/main/LeetCode/Java%20Solutions/Minimum%20Penalty%20for%20a%20Shop/minimum.java).

To check the solution in terminal first compile Java file as `javac minimum.java`, then run the command as follows `java Solution` and it will check tests and if the solution works correctly.

**Explanation**:

The primary task here is to determine the best time for a shop to close in order to minimize the penalty. The penalty arises in two situations:

1. Customers Arrive When the Shop is Closed: If we decide to close the shop at a certain hour and customers come in after that, we'll be missing out on potential business.

2. No Customers When the Shop is Open: On the other hand, if we keep the shop open and no customers come, we bear operational costs (electricity, staff wages, etc.) without any income from sales.

The algorithm can be broken down as follows:

1. Pre-calculation: We pre-compute the cumulative count of hours when customers (represented by 'Y') would arrive from the end to the start of the day. This gives us a quick way to know how many customers we'd miss if we close the shop at any given hour.

2. Iterate through the day: For each hour of the day, we calculate the penalty:

The penalty for hours when the shop was open but no customers came is simply the count of 'N' characters up to that hour.
The penalty for the customers we'd miss if we closed the shop at that hour is fetched from our pre-computed list.

3. Determine the minimum penalty: We track the hour which gives us the minimum combined penalty, and that's our result.

**Implementation**:

Imagine a café located near a tourist attraction. The café has monitored its customer visits for a week to determine the best time to close, balancing between serving customers and saving on operational costs.

Based on the logs, they've observed patterns like:

- Morning rush: Many tourists arrive in the morning.
Afternoon lull: There's a period in the afternoon when very few visitors come.
- Evening surge: The café sees another influx in the evening when tourists return from the attraction.
- The café wants to optimize its hours to ensure that it serves most of its customers while also not staying open during long lulls.

Using this algorithm, the café can input its customer logs and determine the best time to close. If the logs were something like "YYNYYYYNNYYY", the café might find that closing during the afternoon lull and opening again in the evening is optimal, or maybe closing just after the evening surge would result in the least penalties. This decision will depend on the combined penalties of missed customers and hours open without customers.

In essence, this solution can aid businesses in optimizing their operational hours based on foot traffic, ensuring they can save costs while serving as many customers as possible.
