Problem description of "Frog Jump" can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/frog-jump/) and its solution [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/LeetCode-HR-MAANG/blob/main/LeetCode/Java%20Solutions/Frog%20Jump/jump.java).

To check the solution in terminal first compile Java file as `javac jump.java`, then run the command as follows `java Solution` and it will check tests and if the solution works correctly.

**Explanation**:

The basic idea is to use dynamic programming to record the reachable states from every position. Here's the breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialization: Create a map (Python dictionary or Java HashMap) where the keys are the stone positions and the values are sets containing jump distances that reached that position. We initiate the first stone with a jump distance of 0.

2. Iterative Process: For each stone, check the jump distances that got you there. Using each of those distances, try to jump to the next stone using one of the three allowed jump distances: k-1, k, or k+1. Note that k is not always available. For example, if the last jump was of distance 0, then only k+1 is valid.

3. Checking: For each potential jump:
If the target stone (after jumping) exists, update the map to record the jump distance that gets you to this new stone.
If this new stone is the last stone and we can reach it, then return True.

4. Final Decision: If we have iterated over all stones and jump distances, and still can't reach the last stone, return False.

**Implementation**:

Imagine a real-life scenario of a game where players are required to cross a series of platforms separated by varying distances. Some platforms are close together, while others are farther apart. A character in the game has the ability to jump a certain distance, and the farther they go, the more they adapt, being able to jump slightly shorter or slightly farther than the previous jump.

Players must strategize the sequence of jumps to get to the final platform. The game levels are generated by giving the positions of the platforms (stones in our problem). The game needs to determine if a level is solvable or not (can the player cross all the platforms to reach the final one?).

Using this algorithm, the game developer can:

1. Automatically validate if a level is solvable before releasing it to the players.
2. Adjust the difficulty of the level by tweaking the distances between platforms.

The map to be used in our code represents the game's memory of which platforms (stones) have been reached using a certain jump distance. As the character tries to jump between platforms, the game uses this memory to quickly determine the next possible jumps without re-computing every possibility from scratch. This makes the game efficient and avoids unnecessary calculations.

In essence, the solution maps out every possible path the frog (or game character) can take, and then determines whether one of those paths leads to the last stone (or platform). If one does, then the frog can cross the river, otherwise, it cannot.
